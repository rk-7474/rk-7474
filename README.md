## 👋 Hey there!

### I'm a 17-year-old developer exploring the intersection of AI and software engineering

🏫 High school student by day, developer by night (and weekends, and lunch breaks...)

🔭 Currently building:
- AI-powered systems that solve real problems
- Web applications with modern frameworks
- Native client apps that people actually want to use

🧠 Passionate about leveraging AI APIs to create tools that augment human capabilities

💻 Tech stack: TypeScript, Node.js, Python, Next.js, Docker, and whatever new tech caught my attention this week

🌱 Learning: Easily deploy code as solo dev, system designing, microservices communication and integration strategies

🚀 Building in public and documenting my journey from high school coder to wherever this path leads

📫 Reach me on github DMs!
